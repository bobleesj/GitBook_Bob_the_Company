# A Letter from Bob

Thank you for visiting. My name is Bob, and I'm an iOS instructor and blogger. As someone who has been teaching for the last 5 years and grew up in developing countries, I understand the value of knowledge and life-long learning. I believe education is the only way for anyone to rise up and increase one's standard of living and quality of life. I've decided to work towards providing affordable and global education. Anyone should have an equal opportunity to learn regardless of economic, gender, religious, racial, and any other backgrounds. I've started of teaching iOS Development with the Swift Programming Language. In 2017, my primary goal is to increase my personal brand and raise startup capital to work towards the goal.
