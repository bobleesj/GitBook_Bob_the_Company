# Gender Wage Gap

## Issue
77 cents per $1 is created by the median earning of all women working full time divided by men's.

These numbers don't reveal many including
 - Education
 - Position
 - Hours per week
 - Occupation
 - Age

American Association of University Women shows that the actual wage gap is 6.6 cents. It's the individual career choices men and women make.

In 2009, the US Department of Labor revealed a paper peer-reviewed by 50 studies concluded that the oft-cited .23 wage gap may be almost entirely the result of individual choices being made by both male and female workers.

Georgetown University came up with the five best-paying college majors between men and women.

### Five Best Paid Majors
| Rank | Job | Male Percentage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Petroleum Engineering | 87% |
| 2 | Pharmaceutical Sciences | 48% |
| 3 | Mathematics and Computer Science | 67% |
| 4 | Aerospace Engineering | 88% |
| 5 | Chemical Engineering | 72% |


### Five Worst Paid Majors
| Rank | Job | Female Percentage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Counseling and Psychology | 74% |
| 2 | Early Childhood | 97% |
| 3 |  Theology and Religious Studies |66% |
| 4 | Human Services and Community Organization | 81% |
| 5 | Social Work | 88% |

### Nursing
Male nurses earn more 18% than females due to
 - More likely to work longer hours
 - Willing to relocate for best paying positions

There are too many variables. Men are vastly more represented in dangerous workplaces. Research done by Chicago business school said, wage gap for females MBAs with kids have near 45% wage gab while 22%. Women did more than men when it comes to raising children. As a result, women spend more time on unpaid work than men.[^1]

### Others
92% work related deaths are from men in 2012 by U.S Bureau of Labor Statistics [^2]

## Conclusion
Gender income difference exists. I wouldn't call it as inequality, but rather as a consequence due to the biological difference between men and women. Women  must go through pregnancy in order to continue the humanity. The biological difference made women significantly spend more time with a baby starting from the womb to breastfeeding. Unfortunately, it is not paid. From the market's stand point, however, it's a challenge because men, on the other hand, are able to spend more time getting paid. For instance, if I had a kid to take care of, I would not be able to give everything I have. It's impossible, thus not producing as much as I could without one. So, the median income gab must exist in order to counter balance the time women must spend besides working. Besides that, there should be no difference in wage by hour if a woman is single and works the same number of hours and education compared to a man.
