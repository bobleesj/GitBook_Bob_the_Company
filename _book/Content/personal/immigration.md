# USA Green Card
In 1990, Congress created the EB-5 program to stimulate the U.S. economy through job creation and capital investment by foreign investors.

## Job Creation Requirements
An EB-5 investor must invest at least one million dollars in a new commercial enterprise that will create full-time positions for at least 10 qualifying employees.

### Terms
A **troubled business** is a business that has been in existence for at least two years and has incurred a net loss during the 12 or 24 month period by at least 20 percent.

A **qualifiying employee** is a U.S citizen, lawful permanent resident or other immigrant authorized to work in the United States including, not limited to, a conditional resident, a temporary resident, an asylum, a refugee, or a person residing in the US under suspension of deportation. This definition does not include foreign workers including H-1Bs.

**Full-time employment** means employment of a qualifying employee by the new commercial enterprise in a position that requires a minimum of 35 working hours per week.

A **job-sharing arrangement** whereby two or more qualifying employees share a full-time position will count as full-time employment provided the hourly requirement.

A **targeted employment** area is an area that, at the time of investment, is a rural area or an area which has experienced unemployment of at least 150 percent of the national average rate.

A **rural area** is any area not within either a metropolitan statistical area (as designated by the Office of Management and Budget) or the outer boundary of any city or town having a population of 20,000 or more according to the most recent decennial census of the United States

## I-526 Form
The applicants must provide evidence that they have made a $500,000 to $1 million U.S. dollar investment of lawful capital in the new commercial enterprise.

 - Proves eligibility for EB-5 program
 - Must be filed in order to obtain EB-5 visa
 - Filed by immigration attorney
 - $1,500 filing fee
 - Link to the form on the USCIS website

### Requirements
An EB-5 eligible project has received/will receive the investment. You may show evidence through articles of incorporation, merger or consolidation certificates, joint venture or limited partnership agreements, state business certificates.

The appropriate investment amount has been made in the project. You may show through bank statements, security agreements, promissory notes, loan, or mortgage certificates, other evidence that sufficiently illustrates the investment amount.

The capital investment was obtained through lawful means (legal source of funds). Evidence: five years of tax returns, pay stubs of the funds coming from earnings from an employer, back account statements, securities statements (if the funds came from trading/bonds/stocks)

The investment will create 10 full-time U.S jobs through a business plan.

The investor will be involved with day-to-day management or will have a policy-making position within the EB-5 project through corporate documents, statement, and description of duties.

## Permanent Residency

U.S. permanent residency is an immigration status that authorizes immigrants to permanently live and work in the United States. EB-5 visa applicants become permanent residents after their I-526 application has been approved by USCIS. However, they become conditional two year permanent residents instead of full permanent residents at this step of the EB-5 visa process. At the end of this period, the investor then applies for full permanent residency by filing the I-829 application. Once this application is accepted, the investor, their spouse and their unmarried children under the age of 21 can permanently live and work in the United States for the rest of their lives. They are also given the option to apply for full U.S citizenship after five years.

## Responsibilities of Permanent Residents
They must pay all applicable taxes by filing income tax returns with the U.S Internal Revenue Service (IRS). This taxation is based on the permanent resident's gross worldwide income.

Green card holders must also pay all applicable state taxes. Like U.S. citizens, male permanent residents between the ages of 18 and 25 must register with Selective Service. Registering with Selective Service makes these men eligible to be drafted into the U.S. military in the event that the United States goes to war.

### Process
It is usually filed by an immigration attorney. The process takes around 1 to 1.5 years for an EB-5 investor to get a conditional green card. It takes 6 to 8 months to receive approval of an I-526 investor petition.
