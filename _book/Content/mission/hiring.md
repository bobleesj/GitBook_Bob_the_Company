# Work with Freelancers
 1. Clearly define the project's scope and schedule. To avoid and confusion, especially if working remotely, it's critical to outline the project's scope, provide clear guidelines, and set deadlines for its completion.
 2. Negotiate ownership of the work upfront. Draft a legal document stating that all work completed belongs to you, the business owner. A good guideline is no more than 20 - 30 percent of the total project price upfront, with the rest of the payments awarded based on the completion of three or four key project milestones.
 3. Clearly state that you are not going to get involved in other work activities.
 4. Create a Cheat Sheets. Freelancers need to know about your brand guidelines. They should clearly understand your company's style, design, and voice.
 5. Treat them like employees, not one-time workers. They are important.
 6. Always communicate with video feed.
 7. Use JIRA and Kanban model (dashboard)
 8.
