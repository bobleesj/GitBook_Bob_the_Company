<h2 id="dividend">Dividend</h2>
<p>For every share of a dividend stock that you own, you are paid a portion of the company&#x2019;s earnings. You get paid simply for owning the stock.</p>
<h3 id="cash-dividends">Cash Dividends</h3>
<p>Regular cash dividends are those paid out of a company&#x2019;s profits to the owners of the business (i.e., the shareholders). A company that has preferred stock issued must make the dividend payment on those shares before a single penny can be paid out to the common stockholders.</p>
<h3 id="special-one-time-dividends">Special One-Time Dividends</h3>
<p>In addition to regular dividends, there are times a company may pay a special one-time dividend. These are rare and can occur for a variety of reasons such as a major litigation win, the sale of a business or liquidation of a investment. They can take the form of cash, stock or property dividends.</p>
<h2 id="paid-date">Paid Date</h2>
<p>Dividends must be declared (i.e., approved) by a company&#x2019;s Board of Directors each time they are paid. There are four important dates to remember regarding dividends.</p>
<p>The vast majority of dividends are paid four times a year on a quarterly basis, but some companies pay their dividends semi-annually (twice a year), annually (once a year), monthly, or more rarely, on no set schedule whatsoever (called &#x201C;irregular&#x201D; dividends).</p>
<h2 id="employee-stock-option---eso">Employee Stock Option - ESO</h2>
<p>A stock option gives the recipient the right to acquire company common stock at a set exercise price established at the time of grant of the option. If the option is granted early in the life cycle of the company, it will likely be at a favorably low exercise price.</p>
<p>mployees typically must wait for a specified vesting period to pass before they can exercise the option and buy the company stock, because the idea behind stock options is to align incentives between the employees and shareholders of a company. Shareholders want to see the stock price increase, so rewarding employees as the stock price goes up over time guarantees that everyone has the same goals in mind.</p>

<p>Most companies go public to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Raise capital for expansion effort or to pay back debt</li>
<li>Provide an exit for existing investors</li>
<li>Reward employees</li>
<li>Market themselves</li>
</ul>
<p>First, hire the bank. The company and the underwriter figures out the company&apos;s financial needs and how much money it hopes to raise in the IPO. Second, submit documents to the SEC (Securities &amp; Exchange Commission). The registration statement, or S-1 is the formal document that explains the company&apos;s business, potential rick factors, ways it will use the money raised in the IPO, and current ownership of the company&apos;s stock.</p>
<p> Most companies undertake an IPO with the assistance of an investment banking firm acting in the capacity of an underwriter. Underwriters provide several services, including help with correctly assessing the value of shares (share price) and establishing a public market for shares (initial sale</p>

An initial public offering&#x2014;or IPO as it&apos;s most commonly called&#x2014;is the process by which companies go from private to public and sell stocks shares in their firm.</p>
<p>IPOs don&apos;t happen overnight and take a lot of effort to put together. So here&apos;s a look at how the IPO procedure works, as CNBC explains.</p>
<p>What is an IPO?</p>
<p>If a company wants to sell stock shares to the general public, it conducts an IPO. By doing so, a company goes from the status of private (no general shareholders) to public (a firm with general shareholders).</p>
<p>Private companies can have shareholders, but they are few in number and they and the firm are not subject to regulations by the Securities and Exchange Commission. This changes dramatically with an IPO, as we&apos;ll see later.</p>
<p>An IPO usually takes three to four months from the beginning to the first day&apos;s trading on an exchange.</p>
<p>Why does a company go public?</p>
<p>It&apos;s simply a money-making move. The idea is to raise funds and have more liquidity or cash on hand by selling shares publicly.</p>
<p>The money can be used in various ways, such as re-investing in the company&apos;s infrastructure or expanding the business.</p>
<p>An added benefit from issuing shares is that they can be used to attract top management candidates through the offer of perks like stock option plans.</p>
<p>Another plus from going public benefit is that stocks can be used in merger and acquisition deals as part of the payment.</p>
<p>There&apos;s also the prestige&#x2014;bragging rights for some firms&#x2014;of being listed on a major stock exchange like the NYSE or Nasdaq.</p>
<p>What&apos;s the first step in an IPO?</p>
<p>The firm going public hires an investment bank, or banks, to handle the IPO. It&apos;s possible for a company to sell shares on its own but, in reality, that never happens.</p>
<p>Investment banks can work alone or together on one IPO, with one taking the lead. They usually form a group of banks or investors to spread around the funding&#x2014;and the risk&#x2014;for the IPO.</p>
<p>Banks submit bids to companies going public on how much money the firm will make in the IPO and what the bank will walk away with. The process of an investment bank handling an IPO is called underwriting.</p>
<p>When an investment bank, like Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley is eventually hired, the company and the investment bank talk about how much money they think they will raise from the IPO, the type of securities to be issued, and all the details in the underwriting agreement.</p>
<p>What happens next?</p>
<p>After the company and investment bank agree to an underwriting deal, the bank puts together a registration statement to be filed with the SEC.</p>
<p>This statement has detailed information about the offering and company info such as financial statements, management background, any legal problems, where the money is to be used, and who owns any stock before the company goes public.</p>
<p>The SEC will investigate the company to make sure all the information submitted to it is correct and that all relevant financial data has been disclosed.</p>
<p>If everything is OK, the SEC will work with the company to set a date for the IPO. After SEC approval for the IPO, the underwriter must put together a prospectus; that is, all financial information on the company that&apos;s doing the IPO.</p>

<h3 id="how-do-underwriters-make-their-money">How do underwriters make their money?</h3>
<p>A bank or group of banks put up the money to fund the IPO and &apos;buys&apos; the shares of the company before they are actually listed on a stock exchange. The banks make their profit on the difference in price between what they paid before the IPO and when the shares are officially offered to the public.</p>
<p>Competition among investment banks for handling an IPO can be fierce, depending on the company that&apos;s going public and the money the bank thinks it will make on the deal.</p>
<h3 id="what-part-of-an-ipo-is-a-road-show">What part of an IPO is a road show?</h3>
<p>To try and drum up interest in the IPO, the underwriter takes the prospectus and presents it to prospective investors. This is what&apos;s called a road show. These can be trips around the world&#x2014;thus the name road show&#x2014;or can be video or internet presentations.</p>
<p>If a prospective investor likes the IPO, underwriters can legally offer them shares at the price they eventually set before the stock is listed on an exchange. This is called IPO allocation.</p>
<h3 id="how-is-the-price-of-the-ipo-stock-determined">How is the price of the IPO stock determined?</h3>
<p>As the IPO date comes closer, the underwriter and company decide on the price. This can depend on the company, the success of the road show and current market conditions.</p>
<p>Recent transactions on the private market put estimates of the price of a single Facebook share at between $38 and $40.</p>
<h3 id="how-do-investors-get-in-on-an-ipo">How do investors get in on an IPO?</h3>
<p>For small investors, it&apos;s nearly impossible to get any kind of IPO allocation. They usually have to wait until the stock is listed on an exchange, unless they have a very large account with the bank or banks doing the underwriting. Only then would they be offered some shares.</p>
<p>Many market experts say that the small investors should wait and refrain from immediately buying shares of an IPO. That&apos;s because insiders, such as hedge fund managers, are buying up shares that push up the price.</p>
<p>Smaller investors are advised to wait a couple of days for the stock price to settle back down.</p>
<h2 id="process">Process</h2>
<ol>
<li><p>Board approval. The initial public offering (IPO) process begins with a proposal to the company&apos;s board of directors by management of the company. Management presents and discusses in detail the company&apos;s past performance, objectives, business plan, and financial projections. Management then proposes that the company enter the public market. After carefully considering the benefits and detriments of going public, the board of directors makes a decision as to whether the IPO should go forward.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Assembling the team. Upon board approval, management of the company should begin the process of assembling the IPO team. In particular, a securities lawyer and an accounting firm should be retained as soon as possible.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Reviewing and restating the financials. If the board of directors approves the proposal to go public, the company&apos;s financial statements for the preceding five years should be carefully reviewed and, if necessary, restated to comply with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). Certain transactions that are ethical and legally permissible for private companies, such as certain sale-leaseback arrangements, must be eliminated and the financial statements appropriately adjusted. The accounting firm normally assists with the review of the financial statements and the making of appropriate adjustments.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Letter of intent with investment bank. The company should at this point select an investment bank and formalize its arrangement with the investment bank pursuant to a &quot;letter of intent&quot; outlining the investment bank&apos;s fees, the size of the offering, the price ranges and other parameters.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Drafting the prospectus. After the letter of intent is signed, the securities lawyers and accountants begin the process of preparing the prospectus. A prospectus is a written document prepared for presentation to investors as both a selling document and as a legal disclosure document. The prospectus is required to contain the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>A description of the business;</li>
<li>A description of the management structure;</li>
<li>Disclosure of management compensation;</li>
<li>Disclosure of transactions between the company and management;</li>
<li>Names and shareholdings of principal shareholders;</li>
<li>Audited financial statements;</li>
<li>A discussion of the company&apos;s operations and financial condition;</li>
<li>Information on the intended use of the proceeds of the offering;</li>
<li>A discussion of the effect of dilution on existing shares;</li>
<li>A description of the company&apos;s dividend policy;</li>
<li>A description of the company&apos;s capitalization;</li>
<li>A description of the underwriting agreement.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Due diligence. The company&apos;s investment bank and accountants will perform a detailed &quot;due diligence investigation&quot; of the company. They will examine the company&apos;s management, operations, financial condition, competitive position, performance, and business objectives and plan. Information regarding the company&apos;s labor force, suppliers, customers, and industry will also be reviewed. It is likely that information discovered in the due diligence investigation will result in changes being made to the prospectus.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Presenting the preliminary prospectus to the SEC. The preliminary prospectus must be presented to the SEC and the relevant stock market regulators. Approval of state securities commissions may also be required. The SEC usually provides its comments regarding the prospectus, normally in the form of requirements for additional disclosure or explanation, in one to four weeks.</p>
