<p>We sell all the time. Marriage, partners, friends, interview, salary negotiation, trading. We no longer have to view sales as evil. Many sales people have tainted its name. In fact, it&apos;s fun as long as one provides great value to others. Sales should never be forced. Sales should be organic to the point customers can&apos;t wait to brag with others.</p>
