<p>I took a slight nap in the afternoon. Besides that, it was nice to see how the learnswiftwithbob Gitbook page is showing up. Tomorrow will be a better day because I will start recording videos. I can&apos;t wait to see how the course would turn out to be. But, as long as I&apos;m providing great value, it will spread. However, my first shouldn&apos;t be too focused on marketing. In fact, I might release the course for free so that people can purchase my upcoming courses. It&apos;s a great investment that I might have to make. I&apos;ve noticed 24 hours is long as long as I put in the work.</p>
