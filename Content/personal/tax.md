# Tax
Not every person who received income in 2012 has to file a federal income tax return.

For a wage earner, gross income is the amount of salary or wages paid to the individual by an employer, before any deductions are taken

| Filing Status | Age | Minimum Gross Income |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Single | under 65 | $9,750 |
| Single | 65+ | $11,200 |
| Married Filing Jointly | under 65 | $19,500 |
| Head of Household | under 65 | $12,500 |
| Head of Household | 65+ | $13,950 |


In the United States, the term `payroll tax` usually refers to `FICA taxes` that pay into Social Security and Medicare, while 'income tax' refers taxes that pay into state and federal general funds.

Tax deduction: A reduction of income that is able to be taxed, and is commonly a result of expenses.

The definition of net taxable income for most sub-federal jurisdictions mostly follows the federal definition.

Taxable income is gross income as adjusted minus deductions.

Gross income includes all income earned or received from any source. Examples include, rents, interest, dividends.

In the U.S., individuals use Form 1040, corporations use Form 1120, and partnerships use Form 1065 to file their annual returns, while investment income is recorded on Form 1099.

Typically a tax return begins with an identification section and is then divided into three main sections: income, deductions, and credits.

### Income
All forms of income received during the year from all sources. Salaries, dividends, royalties, in many countries, capital gain must be reported.

### Deductions
Taxpayers will then do be entitled to various deductions. Typical examples include contributions to retirement saving plans, alimony paid, interest deductions on certain loans. The taxpayer will be able to determine his/her taxable income and tax payable.

### Pay Quarterly Taxes
Businesses are required to pay taxes on a quarterly basis. During your business's first year, you get a free pass. Then, there are certain expectations based on how much you make. However, even if you're not required by the IRS to pay quarterly taxes, it's still good practice. Waiting to pay a year's worth of taxes in one lump sum can give you quite a shock.

The best practice to stay on top of your quarterly tax obligation is to get the practice of automatically setting aside a percentage of each payment or revenue. A financial advisor can help you estimate these payments if you need some help.

### Keep Track of All Expenses
From the moment you launch, you're able to deduct all business expenses. You need to track. The bottom line is you can't deduct what you can't document. Even if you work at home, you can deduct home office supplies including rent, utilities, insurance costs.

### Separate between Equipment and Supplies
Supplies include things that you use during the year including printer paper, pens, toners. Equipment are typically higher-value items that will last significantly longer than one year. A new computer, server, and office chairs are examples of equipment.


### Pay 1099s
If I've paid freelancers, attorneys, or other individuals more than $600 throughout the year, I'm required to issue 1099-MISC form. If you don't fine, you are expected to get $250 penalty for each form you need to send.
