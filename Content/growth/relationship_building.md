# Relationship
I focus on building long-term relationships over short-term sales. No one likes spam mails and they hurt brand. Instead, I focus on doing the unscalable. I reach out to people individually.  I don't mind sending 1000 emails. It's all about providing value and making them feel special. I care and show respect.

## Platform
 Gitbook, Blog, Website, Facebook, Email list, Instagram, Github, LinkedIn, YouTube.

## Grow Fans
If someone cares enough to send me a descent email for showing gratitude for my work, I must show appreciation. Word of mouth is so much greater than sheer numbers. I rather have 50 people on my email list and engage with them rather than 1,000 people with no interaction.
