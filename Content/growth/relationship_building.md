# Relationship
Focus on building long-term relationships over short-term sales. No one likes spam mails and they hurt brand. Instead, focus on doing the unscalable. Reach out to people individually.  Don't mind sending 1000 emails. It's all about providing value and making them feel special. Care and show respect.

## Grow Fans
If someone cares enough to send a descent email for showing gratitude one's work, one must show appreciation. Word of mouth is so much greater than sheer numbers.  Have 50 people on the email list and engage with them rather than 1,000 people with no interaction.
