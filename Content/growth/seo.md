# Search Engine Optimization
I initially thought word of mouth and social sharing had a lot more weight than organic searches. I was wrong.

## Google Search
Content is king.  SEO comes after. However, there are a couple practices I follow.

 - Name the title identical/similar to the probable search sentence. For example, if people search, "How to become an iOS Developer", my title would be, "How to become an iOS Developer".
 - Drop Keywords in the first paragraph that align with the organic search sentence.
 - Add attributes to images and include keywords.
 - Make the content so good that people share.


## Best Practices for Structuring URLs
 - The more readable by human beings, the better
 - The fewer stop words (a, the, of, but, and, or), the better
 - The fewer folders, the better  

 > It doesn't have to be fancy. I don't have to hire a search engine expert to rank my website or blog post.

## Google Trend Keyword Research
Before I publish websites or blog posts, I do keyword research. I choose keywords whose popularity is in between. It's hard to rank well with generic keywords. For instance, instead of, "How to become happy". I'd choose, "How to become happy while working full-time".
