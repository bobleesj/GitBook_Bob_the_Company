## About
For the first 13 years, I grew up in Korea. I was a decent student. I served as the class representative and did fairly well academically. On May 9th, 2009, however, many have changed. My family moved to Penang, Malaysia. I faced a problem. I had no experience with a language called, English. The barrier seemed insurmountable.  Schools rejected my applications. Although I got accepted eventually, I was bullied by upper classmates. I couldn’t defend myself physically and vocally.

Long story short, I started playing basketball and began making friends and gradually gained my confidence back. On May 2015, I graduated from a renowned international school in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. Throughout my journey, I’ve met friends all around and traveled a dozen countries for tournaments. I was honored to receive the male athlete of the year award and the MVP of the basketball and volleyball team.

I’m 20 years old. I recently stopped pursuing a college after having rejected to transfer my major from chemical to electrical Engineering. On Sept 16, 2016, I took a 14-hour flight from NYC to Seoul, my home country. I did not tell anyone including my family because I couldn’t let any negativity bring me down when I had to figure myself out. Soon, I discovered my blessing. I have been a private teacher for the last 5 years. I’ve decided to teach what I know a little and what the world needs more: programming knowledge.

I consider myself as competitive and ruthless when it comes to my success, fulfillment, and my purpose. I will find a way to compete and innovate.

I do not complain. Complaining is for losers. I only focus on what I’m in control: myself only. I do not regret on decisions that lead to failure. Every failure is a new opportunity granted. Getting rejected to transfer my major was the luckiest incident ever happened in my life. However, I plan to go back to school next summer to pursue a degree in computer science to study AI, Machine Learning, VR, and math in order to strive for the vision.

## Vision
My dream is to provide affordable education channels for all people regardless of gender, religion, sex, race, color, and wealth. Since Sept 17, 2016, I’ve left college in NYC to pursue this goal. I have started off with teaching how to make iOS apps and the Swift Programming Language. In 2017, I attempt to raise as much as funds through teaching so that I can start a company and work with engineers to disrupt the current education system.

I’d like to incorporate education with VR/AR so that students no longer have to physically visit places that are not accessible such as museums, factories, labs, and so on. The integration would provide unmatchable experience especially for the underprivileged.

Our society needs those with low skill jobs. As a result, I do not believe in equality for a standard of living and wealth. However, I believe equal opportunities for all to climb up the pyramid. The future is only limited by our imagination.
