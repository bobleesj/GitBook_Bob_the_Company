# Science of Persuasion
We sell all the time. Marriage, partners, friends, interview, salary negotiation, trading. We no longer have to view sales as evil. Many sales people have tainted its name. In fact, it's fun as long as one provides great value to others. Sales should never be forced. Sales should be organic to the point customers can't wait to brag with others.

### Reciprocity
- If one mint is given, then there is an 3% increase in tip
- If one mint, but later said, “You nice people, here is it"
- It has to be personalized and unexpected

### Scarcity
- Concord Flight from London to the US
- The Turtle price in the store
- It’s not enough to only point out benefits, but also uniqueness
- and what they lose if they don’t

### Authority
- People follow more if certificates
- If worn uniforms, people are more likely to trust more.
- You can delegate through warm introduction
- In real estate, customer talk to realtor first and then introduce specific people.

### Consistency
- Looking for and asking for small first Ex) LinkedIn endorsement. That’s a good way to start
- Consistence bias

### Liking
- People who are similar to us
- People who pay us complements
- People who cooperate with us
- Before you begin agreements, try to share information for each other.

### Consensus
- People will look to the actions of others to determine their own
- “Please reuse the towel to save the environment (35%) —>  75% of our guests reuse their towels (26% increase)
- Rather relying on own ability, point out how others are doing already.

## Factors that increases shares
### Social Currency 
 People like looking smart in front of their friends. Create something that helps them do that and they will share it with others.

### Trigger 
 People share things that are top of mind and tip of tongue, e.g., the terrible song “Friday” by Rebecca Black seeing a spike in views every Friday.

### Emotional 
 Create something that stirs people’s emotions and it will spread. They have to be high arousal emotions, e.g., anger, awe, and joy. Think Donald Trump. For better or worse, he’s a master at tapping into high arousal emotions, which is
why you can’t escape hearing his name on a daily basis.

### Practical
 People like helping people. This is why people share “how to,” type content.

### Public 
 Your content, product, or idea has to be visible for people to share and talk about it.

### Story 
 People learn through stories and love hearing them. If you’re able to master storytelling you have massive power and an unfair advantage.

## How to Improve Your Sales Process and Increase Business
> "Sales is guaranteed to work. Sales will work for anybody"

### Step 1: Prospecting
There are  multiple ways to sell:
- Social Media
- Networking Events
- Cold Market Prospecting with Scripts
- Friendship Farming
- People that your people know
- Centers of Influence (Hey, I respect that you are a successful entrepreneur and I want to be like you and can I get a cup of coffee with you)

### Step 2: Approach and Contact
- Do you have a script?
- “Our body and your body are made of skeletons that are generally the same”

### Step 3: Presentation
- Most people are good at because it is the easier
- It doesn’t make you money. This is important. It ain’t that hard.
- If you catch yourself, talking too much, ask enough questions
- “If I were you, I would do x, y, z"

### Step 4: Follow up
- Follow up is nothing more than discipline
- Details is so important: If you don’t follow up and remember the details, then you are not valuing your time and you just want my money
- The most profitable opportunity typically happens after 7 and 8, 9 times.
- Script again, if the customer rejects, say, “Can I follow up with you within 5 or 6 months from now on?
- I will not going to talk to you, but happy birthday, and thanksgiving, and so on.
- Remember all the details, such as family and so on. “John, remember Bob? I just wanted to call you and how did your wedding go? Something came up in our product and I would like to talk to you"
- You will him again a couple weeks later.
- Don’t be like Nick Young. You only made $2000, there is $100.000 out there.

### Step 5: Referral
- Do you have a script?
- Mention clearly that you make a living as a referral

### Step 6: Maintain Customer Relationship
- Influentials, customers, and they maintain and focus on the industry for 10 years

## How to Network like Casanova - Patrick Bet David
**November 13, 2016**

There are many types who are great networkers:
### The Flirt
 Be bold and be a flirt. Be shameless and be fearless. The girl who dated the hottest girl in school, the guy was generally shameless. Be visible: People will see you over and over.  If a guy is too push, it’s just ugly. You make a list of them today. Don’t invite them back to your place too early. Networking is a relationship. Don’t ask too early and it’s a turn off for most people. It’s not for long term attitude. Write written notes. Disqualify a little when you present a product or idea. It increases curiosity.

### The Detective
Research the person including: Sports Team, nationality, hero, family, hobby, age, married or single, income level, family, education, handshake style, politics.

### The Promotor
 Gifting books and wines, to details “Client, thank you and you’ve been such an amazing client even though many others are emotional". “The best way for you could help me is x,y,z. That’s it”

### The Success
Have a credible name. Have the reputation of being an expert. People do want to know if you are successful. Do it very subtle (Book drop, name drop, location drop)

### The Man
Always help others out first and “How can I help first". Ex) “I wanted to help as many as people possible. I know you are a junior developer, and let me know how I can help”

## Best Methods to Build Rapports
November 14 2016

**Rapport:** Rapport is built through by feeling of commonality. We feel the spark. Too many people rely on words as to get rapport with each other. Only 7% is important. We mirror each other. People like people who are like themselves.

“고객은 내 지갑을 보는 세일즈맨을 원하지 않는다. 고객은 내 마음을 보는 세일즈맨을 원한다."
“유아복점에서 근무하는 이은영 매니저는 전국적으로 매출 상위 1% 안에 드는 판매량을 기록해 ‘에이스 메니저’ 라는 명예의 전당에 오른 사람이다. 그녀는 임신한 여성이 초기에 매장에 와 충동구매를 하려고 하면 고객을 말린다. 앞으로 선물이 많이 들어올 테니 너무 성급하게 사지 말고 막달에 다시 오라고 조언한다. 그러면 판매자 진심을 알아본 고객은 나중에 반드시 다시 찾아오고 단골 고객이 된다는 것이다.
