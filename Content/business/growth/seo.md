# Search Engine Optimization
Some of my articles are visible on Google. I originally thought it was all about word of mouth and social sharing. I was surprised to find out the number of people that came directly from Google.

## Google Search
1. Start title tags with your target keyword:
the closer the keyword is to the beginning of the title tag, the more weight it has with search engines.
2. Drop Keyword in first 100 words.
3. Write click-worthy meta descriptions for each page.
4. Put your target keyword in the URL.
5. Add keywords to your post strategically.
6. Put your keyword early in your title tags

Your target keyword should be part of your imageâ€™s Alt Text. This will improve optimization for your article and also create a clearer picture for the search engines to the relevancy of your article/page.
