# Effective Example Guide
A lot of answers from Stack Overflow are rather boring and not engaging.

## Personality
Avoid using `foo` and `boo`.  It's important to grab their attention first before teaching.

```swift
class Foo {
  var a: Boo?
}
```

Examples should be more fun and familiar. The example below is encouraged.

```swift
class MacBook {
  var battery: Status?
}
```

## Visualization
For student engagement and understanding, visualization is encouraged.The image below is extracted from [Learn Swift with Bob: Recursive Enums](https://learnswiftwithbob.com/course/advanced-swift/nested-generics-recursive-enum.html)

There is a Sketch file on [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/s/02lggumpt408p3n/Team%20Bob%20the%20Developer.sketch?dl=0). You may copy and simply change the name from `BobClass` to `NickClass` for your courses.

## Practicality
When you first introduce the concept, you don't have to make it practical. However, by the end, there should be one or more practical example that the students might find useful for their own projects.
