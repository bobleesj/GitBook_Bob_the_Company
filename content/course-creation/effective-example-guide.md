# Effective Example Guide

### Use Personal Examples
Avoid using `foo` and `boo`. They are boring and it's important to grab their attention first before teaching.

### Rely on Diagrams
Please downlaod Sketch or Powerpoint. Draw the relationships as much as youc can. You can see through the examples shown in [Learn Swift with Bob: Recursive Enums](https://learnswiftwithbob.com/course/advanced-swift/nested-generics-recursive-enum.html)

I've shared the Sketch file with you guys. You may copy and simply change the name from `BobClass` to `NickClass`.

### Practical Examples
It doesn't have to practical from the start. However, each should at least have one practical example with the concept learned.
