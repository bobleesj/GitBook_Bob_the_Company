# Effective Example Guide
A lot of answers from Stack Overflow are rather boring and not engaging.

### Personality
Avoid using `foo` and `boo`. They are boring and it's important to grab their attention first before teaching.

```swift
class Foo {
  var a: Boo?
}
```

Examples should be more fun and familiar.

```swift
class MacBook {
  var battery: Status?
}
```

### Visualization
Course diagrams are created with [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com/). Visualize the relationship. You can see through the examples shown in [Learn Swift with Bob: Recursive Enums](https://learnswiftwithbob.com/course/advanced-swift/nested-generics-recursive-enum.html)

There is a Sketch file on [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/s/02lggumpt408p3n/Team%20Bob%20the%20Developer.sketch?dl=0). You may copy and simply change the name from `BobClass` to `NickClass` for your courses.

### Practical Examples
When you first introduce the concept, you don't have to make it practical. However, by the end of the lessons, there should be at least practical example that the students might find useful for their real experience with programming.
