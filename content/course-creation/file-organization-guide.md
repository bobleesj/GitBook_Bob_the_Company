# File Organization Guide

### Source Code Management
I recommend you connect Dropbox folder with Github so that you may backup and allow better collaboration.

[Learn Swift with Bob](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/jd1qxvciwiuiwsu/AADvYo-2rusI4LR-5q3t0nDca?dl=0)

> You can follow the naming guide.

Everything is lower cased and for source code, space is connected with `_`.

Once you've install DropBox in your local machine. You can simply copy the link and organize as shown by the spreadsheet.

### Progress Management

### URL Guide for Documenting
Look at the how the folders are managed through inspecting Learn Swift with Bob [Github](https://github.com/bobthedev/Course_Learn_Swift_with_Bob) and https://learnswiftwithbob.com

The name of the sub-folder should be organic
> intermediate-swift/delegate-datasource (Preferred)
> 2000_intermediate_swift/2005_swift_fundamentals (bad)

For search engine optimization, URL should be human readable and `-` is favored than `_` for spacing between words.
