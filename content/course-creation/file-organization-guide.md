# File Organization Guide

## Source Code Management
Connect Dropbox folder with Github so that you may backup and allow better collaboration. Refer to the Learn Swift with Bob [Dropbox Folder]((https://www.dropbox.com/sh/jd1qxvciwiuiwsu/AADvYo-2rusI4LR-5q3t0nDca?dl=0).

### Naming Guideline
The name is lower cased and connected with `_`. Remove filer/stop words such as `of`, `the`, `a`, `and`, `for`, `by`. Lesson 4 of Chapter 4 should be

> 4004_delegate_data_source (Preferred)

### Source Code Link
Students want to download the source code. Instead of using Github, copy the custom link from Dropbox as shown on the  [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11-O3amCJin7L3N191H_D71evUunnEUmogyIbhzwP71M/edit?usp=sharing).
