### While Recording
 - Quick time player - Screen Recording `cmd-shift-0`
 - Simple Mouse Locator `opt-a`
 - Zoom it shortcuts `opt-z` and `ctrl-0` to change shape, `ctrl-[/]` size of box, `ctrl--/+`
 - Connect with your phone through Quick time player for demonstration. Smooth and better experience and 60fps
 - I recommend you to get s sketch file. I share through Dropbox and they can simply add their own names and change the examples.
