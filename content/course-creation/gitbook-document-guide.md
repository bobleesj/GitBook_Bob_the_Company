# GitBook Document Guide
[GitBook](https://www.gitbook.com) allows you to generate a website using [Markdown](https://learnswiftwithbob.com/content/development-tools/markdown.html) and Terminal with simple instructions. You may refer to the official  [tutorial](https://toolchain.gitbook.com/setup.html).

## URL Guide for Documenting
The name of the sub-folder should be organic for search engine optimization. The URL should be readable and words are connected with `-` is rather than `_`

> intermediate-swift/delegate-data-source (o)

> 2000_intermediate_swift/2004_delegate_data_source (x)

## Tips for Translation
You are encouraged to download the script on [Github](https://github.com/bobthedev/Course_Learn_Swift_with_Bob) and translate while the table of content and images are in placed. You might have to change the source code links, title for images, and examples.

## Text Editor
For lecture notes, the [Atom](https://atom.io/) text editor is favored. But, you may choose your favored text editor.
