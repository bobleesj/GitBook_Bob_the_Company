# Course Creation Overview
To create an online course, I recommend you to take a look at the 7 step process below. There are links and external articles available. However, if you have questions, feel free to contact me directly on Slack. I will be more than happy to help.

### Step 1. Research and Learn
If you are one of my partners, you should know all the course materials. If you have a lack of understanding, you should try to figure out own your own.

### Step 2. Organize Lecture Notes and Examples
Many examples use "Bob" examples. I recommend you to organize your own examples. For example, if your name is Nick, feel free to change `BobClass` to `NickClass`. It adds authenticity and shows your students that you've done the homework instead of just copying and paste. Always try to use examples that are catchy and practical. For organizing source code, please refer to

### Step 3. Document
Once you the examples on your own, you should either translate or briefly explain them in your
I write the script down on GitBook. When you write it down, it tends to stay longer and it is easier for you update the course material when a new version of Swift is released. Also, it is a great marketing tool.

### Step 4. Write Script
Now, you should write down the script for Introduction and conclusion of each video and each chapter. You may simply translate what's already written.

### Step 5. Record Lectures
You've got all the examples. You may use all the [software]()  and [hardware]() to record the videos. You may record the intro and conclusion videos. I normally record them at once.

### Step 6. Edit
I like to use jump cut for introduction and conclusion videos so that I don't have to memorize the entire script nor waste time with filler words such as "um". However, I have to remind you that it requires a bit more time editing.

### Step 7. Publish
You may bulk upload lessons on Udemy. If it is your first time making a course on Udemy, you have to submit a test video. You can find more [here](https://teach.udemy.com/test-videos/).
