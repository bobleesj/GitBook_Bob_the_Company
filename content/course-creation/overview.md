# Course Creation Overview
For your effective course creation, we've designed a 6-step process. There are external links and articles available.

### Step 1. Research
You have completed the course and read through the GitBook document. You are familiar with the examples and topics.

### Step 2. Organization and Preparation
It's time to prepare for your own course material. Many examples use `BobClass`. Feel free to change it to `NickClass`, for example. It adds authenticity to your work. For organizing source code and naming guide, please refer to the guide below.

### Step 3. Documentation
Once you've have your course material ready, it's time to document on [GItBook](https://www.gitbook.com/) as shown in [learnswiftwithbob.com](https://learnswiftwithbob.com). The document not only serves as a marketing tool, but also as the script for the new Swift version. To learn how to organize files and use GitBook, please visit the links below.

### Step 5. Video Editing
For introduction and conclusion, the [jump cut](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-T6zsP3fzw) editing technique is used. It has a couple benefits. You are not required to memorize the entire paragraph and you may void using filter words such as "um" and "like".

### Step 6. Course Submission
You may bulk upload lessons on Udemy. If it is your first time creating a course on Udemy, you have to submit a test video. You may find more about the process [here](https://teach.udemy.com/test-videos/).
