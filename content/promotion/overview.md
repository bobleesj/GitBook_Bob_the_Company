# Promotion Overview
A great product without customers means nothing. Promotion is equally as, if not more, important as producing content.

### Recommendation
 - Use bobthedeveloper.io email to engage with students for personal branding.
 - Share all the docs with me through Google Apps to provide feedbacks and help.

### Customer Management
- Mail Merge for Bulk emails
- First Name to get the first name.
- Join nick@bobthedeveloper.io
- Join sally@bobthedeveloper.io
- I micro manage them until I trust them.
- Email list, everyone is shared together on Google Drive
- Everything is shared on Google Drive among people. Weekly accountability call.

### Learn how to use Excel
 - Trim
 - Get only the first name

### Increase Leads to the landing Page
 - YouTube video
 - Start blogging on Medium and bring them over
 - On GitBook, lead them to discount links. 

### Relationship
Focus on building long-term relationships over short-term sales. No one likes spam mails and they hurt brand. Instead, focus on doing the unscalable. Reach out to people individually.  Don't mind sending 1000 emails. It's all about providing value and making them feel special. Care and show respect.

## Grow Fans
If someone cares enough to send a descent email for showing gratitude one's work, one must show appreciation. Word of mouth is so much greater than sheer numbers.  Have 50 people on the email list and engage with them rather than 1,000 people with no interaction.
